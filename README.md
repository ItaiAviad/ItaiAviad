### Itai Aviad

I study in the 12th grade at Bosmat High School in Haifa and participate in Magshimim, the national cyber education program. I study for a CS degree at the University of Haifa 
via the Etgar program. I plan on completing my CS degree and enlisting to the IDF during the summer of 2026.


I am enthusiastic about Computer Science and Cyber Security, and looking for a job in these fields.
